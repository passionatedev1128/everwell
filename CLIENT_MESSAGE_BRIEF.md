# Client Update - Days 1 & 2 (Brief)

**Subject:** EverWell Project Update - Days 1 & 2 Complete ✅

Hi [Client Name],

I've successfully completed Days 1 and 2 of development: the full e-commerce system (shopping cart, checkout, order management) is now working locally, and I've built the complete user dashboard with profile management and document upload functionality that stores files locally. All features have been tested and are functioning properly in the local development environment, and I'm ready to proceed with Day 3 (UI/UX polish and enhancements).

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
